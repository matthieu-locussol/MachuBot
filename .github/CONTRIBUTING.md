## Setting up your development bot

### Getting started

-  MachuBot is powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) &
   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-  I use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager
-  [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is used as a daemon process manager

I will assume that you already have installed these tools. If it's not the case and if you have
troubles installing them, you should refer to their own documentation.

## Adding a new module

Coming soon...
